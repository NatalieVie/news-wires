It is [prohibitively expensive](https://www.quora.com/How-much-would-it-cost-to-have-access-and-authorization-to-use-Reuters-or-Associated-Press-news-wires-for-publication-online) for an individual
to subscribe to news wire services. Fortunately, all of these services tweet links
to their releases.

Sick of [spin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114512/)? Just watch the wires!
